Created a full-stack company timesheet system. Every "employee" can securely sign up/in to log their hours. Employees can add their time in/out hours. Manager tools allow you to override and update existing entries already posted on the dash and to clear the board.

This application has all the classic CRUD elements typically found in full-stack applications.


This was created using HTML, CSS, Node.js and some vanilla JavaScript. Express.js was utilized as a template handler with a MongoDB database.
This is commonly referred to as the MERN stack.
